failing my CSCI41 midterm
procrastinating on Unit Tests
grumbling while drawing UML diagrams
purposely not indenting code
importing a solution on Python
reading comics on XKCD
realizing Ted Cruz was the Zodiac Killer
getting on Dr. Liu's good side
asking for a deadline extension
adding last-minute comments to spaghetti code
overdosing on Adderall before the exam
contemplating on life's career choices
proudly sticking to the College Pizza diet
making hot-fixes and shipping it on Github
trying to take it easy
