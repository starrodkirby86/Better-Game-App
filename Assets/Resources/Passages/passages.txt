While $$ACT$$, all of a sudden, I saw $$PPL$$. And then everything blacked out.
I was thinking about $$PPL$$ as I was $$ACT$$, until nearby, I swore I saw $$PPL$$. I couldn't think afterwards. It all became fuzzy.
Nothing can spell futility ever more so than seeing $$PPL$$ $$ACT$$! Those were the last words I was sure thinking.
Life was pretty complacent. But as I was $$ACT$$, $$PPL$$ and $$PPL$$ confronted me. I guess $$ACT$$ isn't going to be so easy anymore.
They said to be adamant. But everything changed once $$PPL$$ and $$$PPL$$ came to take me away from the classroom.
In the secret confines of school, I was $$ACT$$, when $$PPL$$ caught me. That was the last thing I remembered.
I saw $$PPL$$ $$ACT$$ in the back. About to say something, $$PPL$$ struck me from behind. What's going on?
Well, $$ACT$$ typically is an easy thing to do. But when you're tied up after the wrath of $$PPL$$, not so much.
People like $$PPL$$ just spring out at you at the worst times. Like when you're $$ACT$$, and $$PPL$ warps you to this dimension.
